python app.py
The application will be running on http://localhost:5001
http://127.0.0.1:5001/projects

Endpoints
GET /: Returns a list of all projects.
POST /updated: Adds a new project. The request body should be a JSON object with a name field.
GET /projects: Returns a list of all projects in JSON format.
PUT /projects/<id>: Updates the name of the project with the given ID. The request body should be a JSON object with a name field.
